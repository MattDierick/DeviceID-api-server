# API Server for F5 Shape DeviceID

Run the docker-compose with ``docker-compose up -d``

This will start 2 containers:

    #. MongoDB container to store DeviceID per Username
    #. NodeJS server

You can connect to the API Server SwaggerUI through http://localhost:3000/explorer

You can import the Postman collection if you want to test through Postman.
